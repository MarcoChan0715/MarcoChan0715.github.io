                <p>Gaming is one of my favourite things to do in my leisure time and there are a lot of genre of games. There are also a variety of gaming consoles for players to choose, for instance, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Swtich and the Xbox Series. I have the PS5 and the Switch and I'm willing to try the Xbox. Personally, Role Play Games, Action-Adventure games are my favourites. The best game I have played in 2023 is The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. </p>

              <p>Building a keyboard is similar to LEGO, choose your favourite pieces and build it together. For custom keyboards, you can choose your own mecahnical switches, keycaps, texture for the keyboard. Each choice brings different effects to the keyboard, for example, smoother typing experience, improving typing sounds and incerease of typing speed! The most important thing is you are able to get creative to personalise your own unique keyboard. The downside of this hobby is quite costly. The basic one cost around £150. </p>

          <div class="hobbies-text">
              <p>Although i am not that professional in video editting, i still shows my passion there. All of my video editting skills are learned from YouTube. Sometimes i will continue to acquire techniques from YouTube in order to have a better knowledge to produce a high quality video, for instance, video transition, adding subtitles, colour grading etc. I hope I can keep my passion in learning more video editting skills and improve the quality of production of videos. Maybe I can become a YouTuber in the future.</p>

              <p>I like to travel to different countries in order to learn local cultures and histories apart from my home country. So far this year, i have been to at least five countries in Asia and Europe. For me, the most memorable place is Japan. They have quite a lot of historic buildings such as shrines. On the other hand, Japan is famous for the anime and video games. There are loads of anime and games relates shops. As a pokémon fanboy, I have visited all of the Pokémon Centers in Tokyo. The photo below is taken from the Sky Tree Pokémon Center.</p>
